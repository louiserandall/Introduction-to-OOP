# Introduction-to-OOP

Compulsory Task 1
In this task, we’re going to be simulating an email message. Some of the logic has
been filled out for you in the email.py file.
● Open the file called email.py.
● Create a class definition for an Email. The initialiser takes in two arguments
and stores them as instance-level variables:
○ from_address - the sender’s email address.
○ subject_line - the subject of the email.
○ email_contents - the content of the email.
● In addition, the initialiser will create two more instance-level variables with
default values:
○ has_been_read - initialised to False.
○ is_spam - initialised to False.
● Create a function in this class called mark_as_read which should change
has_been_read to true.
● Create a function in this class called mark_as_spam which should change
is_spam to true.
● Create another class called Inbox to store all emails (note that you can have
a list of objects). The initaliser doesn’t take any arguments, and only
initialises an empty list. This list is where all of your Email objects will be
stored.
● Within the Inbox class, create the following methods:
○ add_email(self, from_address, subject_line, email_contents) -
which takes in the contents and email address from the received
email to make a new Email object and store it in the inbox.
○ list_messages_from_sender(self, sender_address) - returns a
string showing all subject lines in emails from a specific sender, along
with a corresponding number. For example, if there are three emails
sent from a specific person::
0 Welcome to HyperionDev!
1 Great work on the bootcamp!
2 Re: Your excellent marks
○ get_email(self, sender_address, index) - returns the email at a
specific index from a specific user. In the example above, given the
same sender_address, an index of 0 will return the email with the
subject line “Welcome to HyperionDev!”. Once that email has been
returned, set its has_been_read instance variable to True.
○ mark_as_spam(self, sender_address, index) - Using the same
indexing as above, mark the email at a specific index within a sender
address as spam.
○ get_unread_emails(self) - should return a string containing a list of
all the emails that haven’t been read. Only the subject lines need to
be shown.
○ get_spam_emails(self) - should return a string containing a list of all
the emails that have been marked as spam.
○ delete(self, sender_address, index) - deletes an email in the
inbox.
